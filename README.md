Final exercise of the advanced topics module with Javascript, my object was to simulate the operation of a back-end using json-server, where I used Javascript to consume it and display data on the screen dynamically

Before running the index.html file make sure that the json-server server is active,
To do this, simply use the "npm run server" command in the vscode integrated terminal.
